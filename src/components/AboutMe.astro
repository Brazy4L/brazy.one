<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>
  Since I was a little kid I have been heavily into computers. Did a whole lot
  of gaming and learning the ins and outs of a PC and various software. Later my
  life took me on a path of esports. But something inside of me was missing. So
  after some time I've realized it wasn't for me and I've begun soul-searching.
  In April 2022, I found my passion - web development. Since that time I've been
  grinding tirelessly and I'm finally ready to present myself to the world. My
  lifelong mission would be to make the web dark. THANK YOU!
